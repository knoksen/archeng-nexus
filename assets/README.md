# Assets Directory

This directory contains application assets including icons for the desktop application.

## Icon Requirements

For Windows applications, you need:
- icon.ico (256x256 Windows icon format)
- icon.png (512x512 PNG for other uses)

Current placeholder icons are basic. For production, replace with professionally designed icons.
