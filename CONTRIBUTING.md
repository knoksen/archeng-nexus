# Contributing Guidelines

Thank you for helping improve ArchEng Nexus! To keep the project history clear and useful, please use descriptive commit messages.

## Commit Messages

- Summarize the change in the first line. Keep it short but specific.
- Include any important context in the body if needed.
- Ensure the summary reflects the actual changes in the commit.

For example, if you update a GitHub workflow you might write:

```
Update SLSA workflow to v2.1.0 and fix output variable
```

Following this approach makes the commit log easier to read and understand.
