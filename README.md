# ArchEng Nexus

ArchEng Nexus is a prototype landing page for a next-generation architecture and engineering platform. The site showcases features like AI automation, sustainable materials, and integrated design tools.

## Running Locally

Open `index.html` directly in a browser or start a simple web server:

```bash
python3 -m http.server
```

Then visit `http://localhost:8000`.

## Updating Content

All landing page text and lists are loaded from `data/site-info.json`. The file
contains keys for the page `title`, `description`, and arrays for `features`,
`materials`, `tools`, and `solutions`. Each array item defines the text and icon
classes used by the page.

Example structure:

```json
